# Onboarding Scripts

## Script 1: First Client Call

### Opening (2 minutes)

> "Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat today. I'm excited to learn more about your business and see how automation might help.
>
> Before we dive in, can you give me a quick overview of what you do and who you serve?"

### Discovery Questions (10-15 minutes)

**Understanding the Business:**
> "What does a typical day look like for you and your team?"
>
> "Where do you spend most of your time that feels repetitive or low-value?"
>
> "What tools do you currently use? CRM, email, project management, etc.?"

**Identifying Pain Points:**
> "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one thing tomorrow, what would it be?"
>
> "What tasks do you dread doing each week?"
>
> "Where do things fall through the cracks? Missed follow-ups, delayed responses, etc.?"

**Understanding Impact:**
> "How much time do you think your team spends on [specific task] each week?"
>
> "What's the cost of those errors or delays? Lost deals, unhappy customers, etc.?"
>
> "If this was automated, what would you do with the extra time?"

### Presenting the Opportunity (5 minutes)

> "Based on what you've shared, I see [X] clear automation opportunities:
>
> 1. [Automation 1] — This would save you [X] hours/week
> 2. [Automation 2] — This would eliminate [problem]
> 3. [Automation 3] — This would improve [outcome]
>
> Would you like me to put together a proposal showing exactly how we'd implement these and the ROI you can expect?"

### Closing (2 minutes)

> "Great. I'll send over a proposal by [day]. It'll include the exact scope, timeline, investment, and expected results.
>
> Any questions before we wrap up?"

## Script 2: Requirements Gathering

### Introduction

> "Thanks for moving forward. This call is about getting the details I need to build your automations exactly right.
>
> I'll ask specific questions about each workflow. Feel free to share screens if it helps explain your current process."

### For Each Automation

> "Let's walk through [Automation Name]:
>
> 1. **Trigger:** What event starts this process? (e.g., form submission, payment, new email)
>
> 2. **Data:** What information needs to move? (e.g., name, email, amount, date)
>
> 3. **Destination:** Where does this data need to go? (e.g., CRM, spreadsheet, email)
>
> 4. **Conditions:** Are there any rules? (e.g., only for certain products, above certain amount)
>
> 5. **Notifications:** Who needs to be alerted and how? (e.g., Slack, email, SMS)
>
> 6. **Edge cases:** What happens when [X] goes wrong? How should we handle errors?"

### Access Requirements

> "To build this, I'll need:
>
> - Admin access to [Tool 1]
> - API credentials for [Tool 2]
> - Access to your [spreadsheet/database]
>
> I'll send you a secure form to share these credentials. Everything is encrypted and I only use access for building your automations."

### Confirmation

> "Let me read back what I've captured to make sure I've got it right:
>
> [Summarize each automation]
>
> Does that match your expectations? Anything I've missed?"

## Script 3: Automation Qualification

Use this checklist to determine if a task is a good automation candidate.

### The RICE Framework

| Criteria | Score 1-5 | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **R**epetitive — Does it happen frequently? | | Daily = 5, Weekly = 3, Monthly = 1 |
| **I**mpactful — Does it affect revenue or time? | | High = 5, Medium = 3, Low = 1 |
| **C**lear — Are the steps well-defined? | | Very clear = 5, Somewhat = 3, Vague = 1 |
| **E**asy — Is it technically feasible? | | Easy = 5, Moderate = 3, Complex = 1 |
| **TOTAL** | /20 | |

**Interpretation:**
- 16-20: Excellent automation candidate — prioritize this
- 11-15: Good candidate — include in proposal
- 6-10: Possible — may need simplification
- 1-5: Poor candidate — suggest alternative approach

### Red Flags (Do Not Automate)

- Process requires human judgment for each case
- Rules change constantly or are undefined
- Data is unstructured or inconsistent
- No clear trigger event
- Client can't articulate the current process

### Green Flags (Great Automation)

- Same steps every time
- Clear trigger (form, payment, email, schedule)
- Data moves between apps they already use
- Current process is documented or easily explained
- Client is frustrated with manual work
