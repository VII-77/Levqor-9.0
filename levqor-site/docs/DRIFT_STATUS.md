## Backend API Domain Status

### Custom Domain: api.levqor.ai ✅ HEALTHY

**Last Verified:** November 24, 2025 08:11 UTC

**Production Status:** Fully operational and serving all backend endpoints correctly

| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `GET /health` | ✅ HTTP 200 | ~500ms | Returns `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET /api/usage/summary` | ✅ HTTP 200 | ~600ms | Returns aggregate metrics |

**DNS Configuration:**
- ✅ Resolves to: `34.111.179.208`
- ✅ Cloudflare DNS-only mode (no proxy)
- ✅ TXT verification record present

**TLS Certificate:**
- ✅ Subject: `CN = api.levqor.ai`
- ✅ Issuer: Let's Encrypt (E7)
- ✅ Valid until: Feb 22, 2026
- ✅ Auto-renewal enabled

**Known Issue:**
Replit Publishing UI shows domain status as "failed" - this is a cosmetic UI bug. The domain is verified healthy via direct `curl` testing and is considered the production-primary backend endpoint.

**Fallback:**
Internal domain `levqor-backend.replit.app` remains available as backup.
