Add a full Onboarding UX Audit and fix the new-user sign-up clarity in one pass.

Context:
- Levqor X V10 is live with all 10 phases passing.
- Technical onboarding works, but UX copy is unclear for new users (no explicit “create account” wording).
- I want the system to:
  (1) Make sign-up / account creation obvious to humans.
  (2) Add an automated Guardian audit so this kind of issue is caught in the future.

PHASE 1 — Fix Signup / Account Creation UX (Copy + Routes)
1. Homepage hero:
   - Keep the primary CTA label as: “Start free trial”.
   - Under/near that button, add clear microcopy in all 9 languages, e.g.:
     EN: “New to Levqor? This will create your account and start your free trial.”
     (Add equivalent strings to the i18n message files for all locales.)
   - Ensure the secondary CTA/link clearly reads:
     “Already have an account? Sign in”
     and is localized.

2. Header/nav (logged-out state):
   - Ensure there is:
     - A prominent “Start free trial” or “Get started” CTA.
     - A clear “Sign in” for existing users.
   - Add a small helper text in an appropriate place (auth box, FAQ, footer) like:
     “No account yet? Click ‘Start free trial’ to create one.”
   - Localize this via next-intl.

3. /signup alias:
   - Add a /signup route/page that redirects or forwards to the existing onboarding/trial flow.
   - This should NOT duplicate logic; just reuse the same flow as the main CTA.
   - Ensure it does not break NextAuth, Stripe, or existing routes.
   - Update any FAQ or legal copy where it helps to say:
     “To create a new account, start your free trial or visit /signup.”

4. Safety:
   - Do NOT change backend auth or Stripe logic.
   - Do NOT touch secrets.
   - Keep all flows functionally identical; this is copy/UX/navigation clarity only.

PHASE 2 — Implement Onboarding UX Audit Script
1. Create a new script:
   - File: scripts/autopilot/onboarding_ux_audit.py

2. Behavior:
   - Fetch the frontend HTML for at least:
     - PRODUCTION: https://www.levqor.ai/ and https://www.levqor.ai/pricing
     - Allow override via env (e.g. FRONTEND_BASE_URL) for dev if this pattern already exists.
   - Scan the HTML content for key onboarding signals:
     - New-user CTA keywords: “create account”, “start free trial”, “get started”, “sign up”, “start your trial”.
     - Returning-user CTA keywords: “Sign in”, “Log in”.
     - Account/trial clarity: text near the primary CTA mentioning “account” or “trial”.
   - Produce a JSON report at:
     workspace-data/autopilot/onboarding_ux_audit.json
     with fields:
     - new_user_cta_found: true/false
     - returning_user_cta_found: true/false
     - account_clarity_found: true/false
     - status: "PASS" | "WARN" | "FAIL"
     - messages: [string, ...]
   - Logic:
     - PASS if:
       - new_user_cta_found == true
       - returning_user_cta_found == true
       - account_clarity_found == true
     - WARN if:
       - CTAs are present but account_clarity_found == false
       - (e.g. “Start” but no mention of account/trial)
     - FAIL if:
       - new_user_cta_found == false
       OR
       - Only sign-in/login language is found without any new-user CTA.

3. Robustness:
   - Handle network errors gracefully (set status to WARN with message).
   - Do not crash the entire verification suite if frontend is temporarily unreachable.

PHASE 3 — Integrate Onboarding UX Audit into Existing Verification
1. Update scripts/postlaunch/verify_full_stack.py:
   - Import and call onboarding_ux_audit.
   - Include its status in the final printed summary.
   - If onboarding_ux_audit returns FAIL, mark the overall verification as WARN or FAIL (depending on the existing conventions in this script).
   - If WARN, still allow other checks to pass but clearly show the warning.

2. Update scripts/autopilot/founder_digest.py:
   - Read onboarding_ux_audit.json (if present).
   - Add a new section “Onboarding UX” to the Founder Digest with:
     - Status: PASS/WARN/FAIL
     - Short human-readable explanation (e.g. “New-user CTA and account clarity detected” or “No obvious new-user CTA detected on homepage”).

PHASE 4 — Run and Verify
1. Run the full CI/safety suite:
   - `cd ~/workspace && python scripts/ci/run_all_checks.py`

2. Run the full postlaunch verification:
   - `cd ~/workspace && python scripts/postlaunch/verify_full_stack.py`

3. Confirm:
   - No TypeScript/Next.js build errors.
   - The homepage and pricing page now clearly show how a new user creates an account.
   - onboarding_ux_audit.json exists with sensible data.
   - The verification summary includes an onboarding UX line.
   - The Founder Digest includes the new section.

Constraints:
- Do NOT modify secrets or environment variables.
- Do NOT change backend security or billing logic.
- Treat this as a UX + audit-layer enhancement only.
