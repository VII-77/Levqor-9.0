PHASE 0-RESYNC — “Scan & Verify Current Levqor State (READ-ONLY, NO WRITES)”

Goal:
Re-scan the entire repo AFTER the v19–v22 work, and produce a clear list of what is PRESENT, PARTIAL, or MISSING versus the blueprint (workflows, Brain builder, approvals, templates, health, marketing, reports, docs, scaling, compliance). This command MUST NOT change any files.

HARD RULES:
- STRICTLY READ-ONLY. Do NOT edit, create, or delete any files.
- Do NOT run migrations or modify DB.
- You MAY run safe listing/grep commands and read files.
- At the end, output a structured summary to the terminal.

STEP A — DISCOVERY
1. Recursively list key directories (read-only):
   - `api/`
   - `modules/`
   - `scripts/`
   - `levqor-site/src/app/`
   - `levqor-site/src/components/`
   - `docs/`

2. For each of these expected back-end modules, check if they exist and briefly inspect content:
   - `modules/workflows/` (models.py, runner.py, events.py)
   - `modules/approvals/` (queue.py or similar)
   - `modules/growth_engine/` (templates.py, referrals.py)
   - `modules/analytics/` (usage.py or similar)
   - `security_core/scaling_policy.py`

3. For each of these expected API blueprints, confirm presence and basic routes:
   - `api/workflows/`
   - `api/approvals/`
   - `api/templates/`
   - `api/health/`
   - `api/analytics/` (if present)
   - Any `api/ai/` builder endpoint for Brain (e.g. brain_build_workflow)

4. For scripts under `scripts/automation/`, confirm presence of:
   - `auto_marketing_cycle.py`
   - `auto_weekly_report.py`
   - `workflow_scheduler.py`
   - `auto_seo_content.py`
   - Any others created in v19–v22

STEP B — FRONTEND COMPONENTS
5. In `levqor-site/src/components/`, confirm presence of these components and briefly read their top-level structure:
   - `dashboard/HealthOverview.tsx`
   - `dashboard/GrowthPanel.tsx`
   - `dashboard/AnalyticsPanel.tsx` (if exists)
   - `dashboard/WorkflowHistoryPanel.tsx` (if exists)
   - `dashboard/ApprovalPanel.tsx` (if exists)
   - `brain/BrainWorkflowBuilder.tsx`
   - `workflows/WorkflowEditor.tsx` (and related Workflow components)
   - `brain/LevqorBrainCanvas.tsx` (for context only, no edits)

6. In `levqor-site/src/app/`, confirm:
   - Templates page route (e.g. `templates/page.tsx`)
   - Help/Docs route if created (e.g. `/help`, `/docs`)
   - Any `/launch` or `/support` pages added.

STEP C — DOCS & BLUEPRINT
7. In `docs/`, confirm presence of:
   - `real_world_alignment.md`
   - `workflows.md`
   - `operations.md`
   - `scaling.md`
   - `compliance.md` (if exists)

8. In root-level docs:
   - `BLUEPRINT_PROGRESS.md` — check latest sections for v19–v22.
   - `DEV_SAFETY.md` — confirm entries for automation scripts & approvals.

STEP D — SUMMARY (MANDATORY, STILL READ-ONLY)
9. DO NOT modify any file. Instead, output to the terminal a structured summary in this format:

   - BACKEND MODULES:
     - workflows: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING (short explanation)
     - approvals: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - growth_engine: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - analytics: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - scaling_policy: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING

   - API BLUEPRINTS:
     - workflows API: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - approvals API: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - templates API: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - health API: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - analytics API: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - brain builder API: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING

   - SCRIPTS:
     - auto_marketing_cycle: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - auto_weekly_report: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - workflow_scheduler: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING

   - FRONTEND:
     - HealthOverview: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - GrowthPanel: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - AnalyticsPanel: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - WorkflowHistoryPanel: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - ApprovalPanel: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - BrainWorkflowBuilder: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - WorkflowEditor: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - Templates page: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - Help/Docs page: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - Launch page: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING

   - DOCS:
     - real_world_alignment.md: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - workflows.md: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - operations.md: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - scaling.md: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING
     - compliance.md: PRESENT / PARTIAL / MISSING

10. Do NOT run `run_all_checks.py` in this command. This is a **pure discovery / resync** phase.

End of command.
