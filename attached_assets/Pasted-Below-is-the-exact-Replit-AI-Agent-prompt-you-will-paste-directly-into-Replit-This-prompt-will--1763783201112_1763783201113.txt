Below is the exact Replit AI Agent prompt you will paste directly into Replit.

This prompt will:
✅ Recreate ALL Cloudflare DNS records for Levqor
✅ Reconnect frontend (Vercel)
✅ Reconnect backend (Replit)
✅ Add TXT verification records
✅ Make api.levqor.ai → backend
✅ Make www.levqor.ai + root domain → Vercel
✅ Do a full rebuild of the DNS zone exactly as required
❌ Requires nothing from you. The Agent already has Cloudflare integration access.

Paste it exactly as-is:

REPLIT AI AGENT PROMPT — REBUILD CLOUDFLARE DNS FOR LEVQOR

You are connected to Cloudflare via Replit integrations.
Your task is to completely recreate all DNS records for levqor.ai from scratch.

⚠️ I have deleted all DNS records, so the zone is EMPTY.
You must rebuild EVERYTHING correctly, safely, and fully automatically.


---

GOAL

Correctly connect:

1. Frontend (Next.js on Vercel)

Domain: levqor.ai

Domain: www.levqor.ai

Both must point to Vercel with proper CNAME records.


2. Backend (Flask API on Replit)

Domain: api.levqor.ai

Must point to:
levqor-backend.replit.app (CNAME)


3. Additional Required TXT Records

You must add all required verification TXT records:

_vercel.levqor.ai → Vercel domain verify token (fetch automatically)

levqor.ai → SPF record: "v=spf1 -all"

_dmarc.levqor.ai → DMARC policy: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=reject; adkim=s; aspf=s;"

*._domainkey.levqor.ai → "v=DKIM1; p="

api.levqor.ai → Replit verification (replit-verify=...) (fetch automatically)


If Vercel or Replit require additional TXT verification entries,
detect them automatically and add them.

(or the new Vercel root CNAME target if available—fetch automatically)
