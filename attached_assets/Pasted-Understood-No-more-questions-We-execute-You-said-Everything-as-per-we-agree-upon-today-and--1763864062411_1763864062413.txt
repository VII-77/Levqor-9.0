Understood. No more questions. We execute.

You said:

> “Everything as per we agree upon today and Finalize the blueprint so I want Everything as per blue print on the app.”



So here’s what happens now:

Blueprint = law.

Today’s state = baseline.

Our only job = force the code to match the blueprint 100%, then ship.


I’ll give you ONE consolidated command block to run via the AI Agent that:

Revalidates ALL blueprint routes.

Ensures every single required page actually exists (page.tsx, not 404).

Ensures nav/footer match the blueprint.

Builds.

Then you commit + push.


You do NOT need to decide anything. Just run it.

PROMPT FOR AI AGENT

Paste this as-is into the Replit AI Agent:

You are working on the Levqor frontend at /home/runner/workspace/levqor-site.

RULES:
- The blueprint is FINAL. You are NOT allowed to improvise routes or remove blueprint routes.
- Your job is to ensure the app matches the blueprint completely.
- Do NOT touch backend, env vars, DNS, or Stripe.
- Frontend only.

THE BLUEPRINT ROUTE SET (MUST EXIST AS REAL PAGES, NOT 404):
- /                 → Home
- /pricing          → Pricing (capsules, DFY, add-ons)
- /signin           → Sign in
- /docs             → Docs index
- /about            → About Levqor
- /careers          → Careers
- /contact          → Contact
- /support          → Support / Help centre
- /how-it-works     → How it works (4-step flow)
- /guarantee        → Guarantee (risk-free, SLA)
- /fair-use         → Fair use policy
- /integrations     → Integrations overview
- /use-cases        → Use cases
- /blog             → Blog index
- /tour             → Product tour
- /screenshots      → Screenshots / gallery
- /roadmap          → Roadmap / “what’s next”
- /team             → Team
- /demo             → Live demo entry (if linked anywhere)
- /dashboard        → Auth-protected (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED – DO NOT TOUCH)
- /dashboard/v2     → Auth-protected SEO-locked dashboard (DO NOT TOUCH)

Anything that exists in nav/footer MUST point to a real page from this list.

------------------------------------------------
0. PRECHECK
------------------------------------------------

From /home/runner/workspace:

```bash
pwd
ls
cd levqor-site
ls -R src/app | sed -e 's/^/src\/app\//'
git status -sb

Confirm:

src/app exists.

Branch: main.

Do NOT run git init. Do NOT change remotes.



---

1. DISCOVER REAL ROUTES




---

List all app routes currently generated:

cd /home/runner/workspace/levqor-site
npm run build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/levqor_blueprint_build.log
grep -A80 "Route (app)" /tmp/levqor_blueprint_build.log || sed -n '/Route (app)/,$p' /tmp/levqor_blueprint_build.log

For each blueprint route above, classify internally as:

OK    → route exists and is NOT the generic 404.

MISSING → there is no route.

404   → route exists but uses the not-found 404 component.


You do not need to print the full classification, just use it to decide work.


---

2. CREATE / FIX MISSING BLUEPRINT PAGES




---

For every route in this list that is MISSING or 404:

Create or replace src/app/<slug>/page.tsx with a proper page component.


Rules:

Use existing layout + Tailwind styling conventions.

Use same design language as /pricing, /support, /about (cards, sections, headings).

Keep content on-brand: Levqor, capsules, DFY automation, workflows, monitoring, self-heal, no BS.

Each page MUST have:

<h1> main heading.

A short lead paragraph.

2–4 content sections with <h2> or <h3> and bullets.

At least one CTA button linking to /pricing or /signin.



Specific expectations:

/how-it-works:

Clear 3–4 step pipeline (Connect → Automate → Monitor → Self-heal).


/guarantee:

Money-back window, uptime/SLA note, “we only get paid when it works”-style messaging.


/support:

Pointers to docs, contact, status, fair-use, guarantee.


/fair-use:

Reasonable usage policy around workflows, concurrency, abuse prevention.


/integrations:

Overview of 3–5 categories (CRM, project tools, comms, storage) and statement “50+ integrations”.


/demo:

Simple page explaining how to request a live demo or watch walkthrough (CTA to contact or signup).


/roadmap:

High-level near-term / mid-term / long-term roadmap bullets.


/screenshots:

Gallery layout (even if you only use placeholder text/images).


/tour:

Short product walkthrough structure.



If a page already exists and is clearly correct (e.g. /pricing, /about, /blog, /use-cases, /team, /support already implemented), DO NOT rewrite it unless it is literally serving a 404 component.

Do NOT copy-paste huge amounts of new text. Use concise sections.


---

3. NAV + FOOTER ALIGNMENT




---

Search nav/footer:

grep -R "Support" -ni src || true
grep -R "How it works" -ni src || true
grep -R "Guarantee" -ni src || true
grep -R "Fair use" -ni src || true
grep -R "Roadmap" -ni src || true
grep -R "Screenshots" -ni src || true
grep -R "Tour" -ni src || true
grep -R "Demo" -ni src || true
grep -R "Use cases" -ni src || true
grep -R "Integrations" -ni src || true

Rules:

Any link in the header/footer that points to a blueprint slug must match the corresponding route.

No nav/footer link is allowed to point to a path that still resolves to the generic 404.

If a link exists to a non-blueprint route, either:

Change it to point at the correct blueprint equivalent, OR

Remove it, if the blueprint does not include that route.



Examples:

“How it works” must link to /how-it-works.

“Guarantee” must link to /guarantee.

“Support” must link to /support.

“Fair use” must link to /fair-use.

“Integrations” must link to /integrations.

“Demo” must link to /demo or /contact according to blueprint hierarchy (prefer /demo if we create the page).


Do NOT break existing working links to: /pricing, /docs, /about, /careers, /blog, /contact, /signin.


---

4. REBUILD AND VERIFY ROUTES




---

After making changes:

cd /home/runner/workspace/levqor-site
npm run build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/levqor_blueprint_post_build.log
grep -A80 "Route (app)" /tmp/levqor_blueprint_post_build.log || sed -n '/Route (app)/,$p' /tmp/levqor_blueprint_post_build.log

You MUST ensure that ALL the blueprint routes listed at the top now appear under “Route (app)” as generated (ƒ /...), not missing.

If build fails, fix errors and rebuild until it passes.


---

5. GIT DIFF (DO NOT COMMIT)




---

From /home/runner/workspace:

cd /home/runner/workspace
echo "=== BLUEPRINT ALIGNMENT DIFF ==="
git diff levqor-site/src/app levqor-site/src/components | sed -n '1,200p'

Do NOT run git commit. Do NOT push.


---

6. FINAL REPORT




---

At the end, output a report with:

List of blueprint routes that were missing/404 and what files you created/changed.

Confirmation that npm run build passes.

Confirmation that every blueprint route appears in the Next.js route list.

Confirmation that nav/footer no longer link to any non-existent routes.


No backend changes. No DNS. No environment changes. Frontend-only. Your job is to make the app match the blueprint completely.

---

Once the agent finishes:

1. Run this manually in Replit to confirm:

```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace
git status
git diff --stat

2. If the diff looks sane (mostly src/app/.../page.tsx and maybe small nav/footer edits), commit and push:



rm -f .git/index.lock
git add levqor-site/src/app levqor-site/src/components
git commit -m "feat: complete frontend to match Levqor v9 blueprint"
git push origin main

3. Wait for Vercel deploy, hard-refresh levqor.ai, and you’re done.



No questions, no deviations, just blueprint → code → live.
