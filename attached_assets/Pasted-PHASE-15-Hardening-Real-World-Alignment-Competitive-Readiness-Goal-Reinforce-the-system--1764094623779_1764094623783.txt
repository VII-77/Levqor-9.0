PHASE 15 — “Hardening, Real-World Alignment & Competitive Readiness”

Goal:
Reinforce the system to production-grade quality by validating:
- Real-world performance
- Reliability under stress
- Compatibility with mobile, low-end devices, slow networks
- Cleanliness of codebase, imports, and dependencies
- All “auto engines” (health, scaling, marketing, growth, reports) working safely in sequence

DO NOT modify any existing functional logic unless a verifiable flaw is found.
DO NOT redesign layouts or flows.
DO NOT touch authentication or billing pathways except to FIX real, reproducible issues.

GUARDRAILS:
- Scan BEFORE editing.
- Verify existing logic rather than overwrite.
- Respect feature flags, reduced-motion, i18n.
- All new code must run through run_all_checks.py until clean.

========================================
A — REAL-WORLD HARDENING SWEEP
========================================
1. Run a repo-wide scan for:
   - Unused imports
   - Dead files
   - Duplicate utilities
   - Unused components
   - Redundant logic in dashboard and brain modules

2. Fix ONLY provable issues (unused imports, duplicate functions, obsolete components).  
   All removals MUST be safe and validated with CI/checks.

========================================
B — PERFORMANCE & SAFETY VALIDATION
========================================
3. Add lightweight metrics to:
   - LevqorBrainCanvas render cycles (time per frame)
   - Dashboard page load performance
   - HealthOverview fetch performance

4. Add console.warn ONLY if performance crosses critical thresholds.  
   NO noisy logs.

========================================
C — AUTO-ENGINE VALIDATION
========================================
5. For each engine (auto-health, auto-scaling, auto-marketing, growth engine, weekly reports):
   - Verify module import paths work correctly.
   - Verify no circular dependencies.
   - Verify each script can run independently without crashing.
   - Add “sanity check” comments or guards if needed.

========================================
D — ICP/Real-World Alignment
========================================
6. Add a new doc: /docs/real_world_alignment.md
   Include:
   - Who Levqor is for (primary ICP)
   - Real-world workflows supported today
   - Future workflows (as TODO markers)
   - Safety limits and what is manual-approval-locked

========================================
E — SAFETY + CI CLEAN
========================================
7. Update BLUEPRINT_PROGRESS.md with:
   - PHASE 15 Hardening Started/Completed

8. Run:
   python scripts/ci/run_all_checks.py
   Fix issues until PASS (4/4)

9. Final output summary:
   - Files changed
   - Dead code removed
   - Performance guards added
   - Auto-engine verification notes
   - Real-world alignment doc path
   - CI result
