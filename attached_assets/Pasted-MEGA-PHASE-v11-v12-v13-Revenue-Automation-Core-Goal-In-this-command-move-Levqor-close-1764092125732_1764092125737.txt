MEGA PHASE: v11 + v12 + v13 (Revenue + Automation Core)

Goal:
In this command, move Levqor closer to “live, making money, self-running”:
- Clear revenue funnel (homepage → pricing → Stripe → onboarding → app).
- Automated onboarding after checkout.
- Basic AI support entry.
- Minimal but real multi-language funnel (based on existing i18n).
- All under existing safety harness.

DO NOT UNDO:
- CI/CD harness (run_all_checks.py, auto_upgrade_policy, auto_deploy).
- Auth fix.
- LevqorBrainCanvas + Brain context + useSoundIntensity.
- Interactions (homepage + dashboard).
- Existing layouts and i18n infra.

GUARDRAILS:
- Scan before edit.
- No layout breakage.
- Respect i18n, feature flags, reduced-motion.
- No heavy new deps unless necessary.
- After all work: `python scripts/ci/run_all_checks.py` and fix until clean.

========================================
A — REVENUE FUNNEL CHECK + WIRING
========================================
1. Scan backend + frontend for existing Stripe usage:
   - `modules/stripe_connector.py`
   - `api/billing/`
   - pricing/checkout related pages in `levqor-site/src/app/`.

2. Confirm:
   - There is at least one main paid plan (or create a simple “Levqor Brain Pro” plan constant client-side using existing pricing config).
   - Pricing page clearly shows:
     - Plan name
     - What user gets (AI workflows, Levqor Brain, etc.)
     - CTA: “Start free trial” or “Get started”.

3. Wire homepage → pricing:
   - Ensure hero CTAs point to pricing or checkout path in a clean, obvious way.

4. Wire pricing → checkout:
   - Confirm a primary button triggers checkout (existing API or link).
   - If multiple confusing CTAs exist, make one “primary money path” visually and semantically dominant.

========================================
B — POST-CHECKOUT AUTOMATED ONBOARDING
========================================
5. Find where Stripe webhook / “checkout success” is handled:
   - Likely under `api/billing/` or scripts like `scripts/verify_live_billing.py`.

6. Implement or extend logic so that on successful checkout:
   - A tenant/workspace is created (or ensured) for that customer.
   - A user account is linked to that tenant.
   - A default set of items is created, e.g.:
     - One default workspace/project.
     - One or two starter workflows (“AI Support”, “Lead Capture”) if the backend supports it.
   - An onboarding flag is set (e.g. in DB or user metadata) to indicate “needs Brain-guided tour”.

7. Add a “post-checkout redirect” route in the frontend (e.g., `/welcome` or `/onboarding`) that:
   - Checks auth.
   - Welcomes the new user.
   - Clearly calls out Levqor Brain as the guide.
   - Has a “Start Quickstart” button that takes them into the dashboard.

========================================
C — BRAIN-GUIDED QUICKSTART (MINIMAL BUT REAL)
========================================
8. In the dashboard (client side), add a small Quickstart panel (new component under `src/components/dashboard/`), e.g. `QuickstartPanel.tsx`:

   - If “first-time user” or “onboarding flag set”:
     - Show a short list of steps:
       1) Describe what you want to automate.
       2) Review the proposed workflow.
       3) Run it once.
     - Include a button: “Ask Levqor Brain to create your first workflow”.

9. Wire that button to:
   - Open an existing AI/Brain-related entry point (e.g., existing AI endpoints under `api/ai/`).
   - For THIS command, you can stub the call as:
     - log a TODO or trigger a simple `fetch` to a placeholder workflow creation endpoint if one exists.
   - The key is:
     - UX is in place.
     - The Brain is clearly positioned as the guide.
     - System is ready to be connected to the real builder in later commands.

========================================
D — AUTOMATED SUPPORT ENTRY POINT
========================================
10. Scan for existing support or contact mechanisms:
    - `api/support/`, support scripts, or any “Support” link in the frontend.

11. Implement a minimal AI-first support entry:
    - A “Need help?” or “Contact support” link/button in the dashboard and/or footer.
    - Point it to a unified support page `/support` (or similar) that:
      - Explains that:
        - AI handles first-line questions.
        - Complex issues escalate.
      - Provides at least:
        - A simple form (name/email/message).
        - OR a note on current support channel (email/Telegram/etc.), using existing config.

    - For THIS command, keep it simple:
      - Don’t implement full AI support chat.
      - Just create the obvious path for complaints/questions.

========================================
E — MINIMAL GLOBAL FUNNEL (I18N USE)
========================================
12. Using existing i18n (next-intl) and messages:
    - Ensure homepage, pricing page, and main CTAs:
      - Are properly wrapped with translations for all configured locales.
      - Show meaningful text for at least the current 9 languages (en, de, fr, es, it, pt, ar, hi, zh-Hans).
    - If any key text is hardcoded in English only, move it into messages and wire it.

13. Ensure:
    - Language switcher (if present) works on homepage + pricing.
    - Critical CTA text (e.g., “Start free trial”) is translated using existing message structure.

(We are NOT adding 40 full languages in this command; we are solidifying the funnel for existing i18n.)

========================================
F — DOCS + SAFETY
========================================
14. Update `BLUEPRINT_PROGRESS.md` to reflect:
    - v11 core (business automation / onboarding) partly done:
      - Post-checkout workspace creation logic.
      - Onboarding redirect + welcome.
      - Quickstart panel stub.
    - v12 funnel base:
      - i18n wired for homepage + pricing.
      - Clear money path.
    - v13 seed:
      - Quickstart templates hooks (even if not fully implemented yet).
      - Support entrypoint.

15. If needed, update `DEV_SAFETY.md`:
    - Describe:
      - How to run the revenue funnel tests.
      - Where the onboarding/redirect logic is.
      - How to test the support entrypoint.

16. Run:
    `python scripts/ci/run_all_checks.py`
    Fix all issues (TS, lint, backend syntax, safety gate) and re-run until passing.

17. End with a concise terminal summary:
    - Files modified/created.
    - How a new user now:
      - Lands on homepage → goes to pricing → hits checkout → returns into onboarding → reaches dashboard.
    - Where the Quickstart panel lives.
    - Where support entry lives.
    - Confirmation of `run_all_checks.py` PASS.
