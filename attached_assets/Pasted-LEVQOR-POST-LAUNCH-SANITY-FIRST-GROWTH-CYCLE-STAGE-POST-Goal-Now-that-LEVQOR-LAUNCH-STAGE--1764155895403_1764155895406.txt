LEVQOR — POST-LAUNCH SANITY + FIRST GROWTH CYCLE (STAGE: POST)

Goal:
Now that LEVQOR_LAUNCH_STAGE="post" is set in Replit and Vercel:
  - Verify production (api.levqor.ai + levqor.ai) is healthy.
  - Run the first real Growth Organism cycle in POST mode.
  - Confirm Guardian Autopilot + Founder Digest reflect the new state.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT rotate or touch any secrets.
- Do NOT change pricing or billing.
- Do NOT weaken security_core, auth, or compliance.
- Keep all high-risk actions behind approval policies.

==================================================
PHASE 1 — FULL STACK PROD CHECK
==================================================
1) If not already present, ensure we have a stack verification script:
   - Prefer scripts/postlaunch/verify_full_stack.py
   - If it doesn’t exist, extend scripts/postlaunch/verify_live.py to also:
       * Hit BACKEND: https://api.levqor.ai
           - /api/health/summary
           - /api/health/launch-readiness or equivalent
           - /api/me/delete-account (unauthenticated 401 is OK)
       * Hit FRONTEND: https://levqor.ai
           - Verify HTML contains expected markers:
               "Levqor" and some known UI text (builder wording, etc.)

2) Run the full stack verification against production:
   - python scripts/postlaunch/verify_full_stack.py --api-base https://api.levqor.ai --frontend https://levqor.ai

3) Record:
   - HTTP status codes
   - Any failing checks
   - Confirm 7/7 or equivalent launch checks PASS for production, not localhost.

==================================================
PHASE 2 — FIRST GROWTH ORGANISM CYCLE IN POST MODE
==================================================
1) Confirm in code (not just env) that:
   - get_launch_stage() or equivalent returns "post" in the backend environment.

2) Run the Growth Organism pipeline once in POST mode:
   - python scripts/autopilot/growth_organism.py
   - python scripts/autopilot/apply_site_mutations.py

3) After running:
   - Confirm:
       * demand_signature.json updated under /workspace-data/autopilot/organism/
       * mutation proposals applied or safely skipped (CI must still be green)
       * Any Git commit output if mutations were safe and applied

4) Ensure high-risk actions (emails to all users, legal text, pricing updates) are STILL only queued and not executed:
   - Verify approvals queue (pending.jsonl) is used for such actions if any were proposed.

==================================================
PHASE 3 — AUTOPILOT GRID & FOUNDER DIGEST REFRESH
==================================================
1) Re-run the Guardian Autopilot Grid scripts:
   - python scripts/autopilot/secrets_health.py
   - python scripts/autopilot/compliance_audit.py
   - python scripts/autopilot/growth_organism_check.py
   - python scripts/autopilot/founder_digest.py

2) Confirm:
   - secrets_health.json: no FAIL entries for critical services.
   - compliance_audit.json: still 100%.
   - growth_organism_check.json: HEALTHY.
   - founder_digest.md: updated with today’s run and POST stage.

==================================================
PHASE 4 — SUMMARY FOR FOUNDER
==================================================
Output a concise summary:
   - verify_full_stack: prod backend + frontend status (all key endpoints OK or list issues)
   - Growth Organism: ran in POST, what it did (proposals applied, pages updated, etc.)
   - Any items queued for approval (high-risk actions)
   - Confirmation that Autopilot Grid + Founder Digest are in sync with POST launch stage

End of command.
