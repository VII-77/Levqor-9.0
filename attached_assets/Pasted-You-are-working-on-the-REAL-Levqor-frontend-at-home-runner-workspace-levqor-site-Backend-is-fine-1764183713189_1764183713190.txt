You are working on the REAL Levqor frontend at:

/home/runner/workspace/levqor-site

Backend is fine. The problems are:

1) Language switching:
   - Header language dropdown changes, but many locales return 404.
   - Only Italian and Portuguese load correctly.
   - Switching BACK to English does NOT work unless the page is refreshed.
   - When it does work, only the hero text changes; not all visible text.

2) Brain:
   - Brain hero exists, but behaviour across locales is inconsistent and may be hitting 404 because of the routing issues.

Your job: **fix the locale routing + default English behaviour + ensure translations apply to the hero and Brain components**, without touching backend code or pricing/auth logic.

====================================================================
0. ORIENTATION – READ CURRENT I18N AND ROUTING
====================================================================

Work only in levqor-site.

Run:

- pwd
- ls
- find src -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort | sed -n '1,200p'

Then open and READ:

- next.config.js and/or next.config.mjs
- src/i18n.ts
- src/i18n/routing.ts (or equivalent routing helper)
- src/config/languages.ts
- src/components/LocaleSwitcher.tsx
- src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx
- src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
- src/components/brain/HomepageBrainDemo.tsx

Understand:

- Which locales are officially supported.
- Which one is the **default locale** (English).
- How the `[locale]` segment is used in routes.
- How the LocaleSwitcher currently builds URLs.

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING until you clearly see why `/de`, `/fr`, `/es` etc can 404 and why `/en` is broken for switching back.

====================================================================
1. FIX LOCALE ROUTING & DEFAULT ENGLISH
====================================================================

Goal: 
- Every configured locale should map to a valid route.
- English should work both as the default (`/`) and when selected again from any locale.
- No 404s when switching language from the header.

Steps:

1) Confirm the config:

   - In next.config and i18n/routing, confirm the list of locales:
     en, de, fr, es, pt, it, ar, hi, zh-Hans (or whatever is actually present in src/messages).

   - Confirm the **default locale**. If it is "en", assume:
     - English homepage = `/`
     - Other languages use `/[locale]/...`.

2) Fix the LocaleSwitcher logic in src/components/LocaleSwitcher.tsx:

   - Mark it as `"use client"` if it isn’t already.
   - Use `usePathname()` from `next/navigation` to get the current path.
   - Write a helper that strips the leading locale from the current pathname:

     Example idea (adapt to actual code):

       const LOCALES = ["en","de","fr","es","pt","it","ar","hi","zh-Hans"];
       const defaultLocale = "en";

       function stripLocale(pathname: string) {
         const segments = pathname.split("/");
         const first = segments[1];
         if (LOCALES.includes(first)) {
           // remove the locale segment
           return "/" + segments.slice(2).join("/");
         }
         return pathname || "/";
       }

   - When user selects `targetLocale`:

     - Compute `basePathWithoutLocale = stripLocale(pathname)`.

     - If `targetLocale === defaultLocale` ("en"):
         - Navigate to just `basePathWithoutLocale` (e.g. `/` or `/pricing`).
     - Else:
         - Navigate to `"/" + targetLocale + basePathWithoutLocale`
           (ensure you avoid double slashes).

   - Do NOT hard-code `/en` as a route if the actual default is `/`.

3) Make sure the locale list used in the switcher matches the routing locales and the messages. No locale in the dropdown should be missing from routing or messages.

4) Run a local quick test (dev or via curl if possible) that these URLs resolve:

   - `/`
   - `/en` (if it’s supposed to exist; if not, make sure the switcher never sends users there)
   - `/de`
   - `/fr`
   - `/es`
   - `/pt`
   - `/it`
   - `/ar`
   - `/hi`
   - `/zh-Hans`

If some of these should not exist by design, remove them from the language switcher so users never see them.

====================================================================
2. ENSURE HERO + BRAIN USE TRANSLATIONS, NOT HARD-CODED ENGLISH
====================================================================

Problem: header text is localized, but the main page and Brain text are only partially localized.

1) Inspect:

   - src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
   - src/components/brain/HomepageBrainDemo.tsx
   - any hero components it uses.

2) For all user-facing strings in the hero and Brain sections:

   - Replace hard-coded English text with translation lookups using the existing i18n hooks or components.
   - Use the same namespace and pattern already used in the header (e.g. `useTranslations("landing")` or similar).
   - Add any missing keys for these strings into ALL message JSON files in src/messages.

   If you don’t have translations for some languages, you may temporarily duplicate the English text in those JSON files, but the keys MUST exist so Next/i18n doesn’t fall back incorrectly or crash.

3) Make sure the Brain demo **does not** try to use any server-only components or router from src/i18n/routing that is incompatible with `"use client"`. For navigation inside the Brain component, use either:

   - `<a href="...">` for simple links, OR
   - `next/link` from `"next/link"` if safe.

====================================================================
3. VERIFICATION – BUILD AND RUNTIME CHECKS
====================================================================

After implementing the fixes:

1) Run:

   cd /home/runner/workspace/levqor-site
   npm run build

   Fix any TypeScript / build errors you introduced.

2) When the build passes, restart the frontend workflow if needed and verify LOGS show no routing errors.

3) Summarize the actual runtime checks you did, including:

   - Visiting `/` and confirming English works.
   - Visiting at least `/de`, `/fr`, `/es`, `/pt`, `/it`:
     - No 404.
     - Header + hero + Brain text visible and in that language (or at least not crashing).
   - Switching back to English via the language switcher from `/pt` and `/it`:
     - Should go back to `/` (or the correct English route) with NO 404 and no refresh required.

====================================================================
4. REPORT BACK
====================================================================

When you’re done, report in this exact structure:

- Locale routing:
  - List of locales and which route each uses (/, /de, /fr, etc.)
  - Confirmation that switching language via the dropdown no longer produces 404.
  - Confirmation that switching back to English works without reload.

- Translations:
  - Which components now read from i18n (hero, Brain, etc.)
  - Any keys added to the messages files.

- Brain behaviour:
  - Confirmation that the Brain demo works on at least English, Italian, Portuguese, and one other locale.
  - Note any remaining limitations.

Do NOT claim success until npm run build passes and you’ve verified at least English + two non-English locales with no 404s via the switcher.
