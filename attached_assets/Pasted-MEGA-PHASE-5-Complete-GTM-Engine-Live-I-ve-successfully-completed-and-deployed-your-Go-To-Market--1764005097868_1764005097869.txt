🔒 Blueprint Protection — All Invariants Preserved
✅ Zero pricing changes
✅ Zero trial/SLA modifications
✅ Zero legal copy edits
✅ Zero database schema changes
✅ Zero DNS/domain changes

Verification Results:

TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
Drift monitor: PASS (no violations)
Both workflows: RUNNING
Architect approval: Production-ready ✅
📁 Technical Details
Data Storage: Uses workspace-data/ directory with JSON files (consultations.json, lifecycle.json) — completely additive, no database changes

PII Handling: Real customer data stored in files, masked only in logs for compliance

Scheduler: Lifecycle engine runs every 4 hours via APScheduler (registered in run.py)

Security: Architect found zero security concerns

🚀 What's Next (Architect Recommendations)
Monitor booking IDs under high traffic — currently using timestamps (low collision risk for demo, but plan UUID migration if traffic grows)
Persistent storage transition — Move lifecycle and consultation data from JSON files to database before GA launch
Track GTM metrics — Use the new counters to validate funnel performance and optimize conversion nudges
